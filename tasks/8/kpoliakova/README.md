#### Problem A - Key Word in Context (KWIC)

I realized this problem with method 2 (Main/Subroutine with stepwise refinement or Shared Data).
Text is hardcoded in program in variable text, for example:

```
text = "For example, a search query including all of the words in an example definition (KWIC is an acronym for Key Word In Context," + \
    " the most common format for concordance lines) and the Wikipedia slogan in English (the free encyclopedia), searched against a Wikipedia " + \
    "page, might yield a KWIC index as follows. A KWIC index usually uses a wide layout to allow the display of maximum 'in context' " + \
    "information (not shown in the following example)."
```

The result of algorith will be written in command line.
